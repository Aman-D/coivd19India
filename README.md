- Not responsive for now ;)

An application to track covid cases in Indian states and thier respective districts using Api's. Also it shows daily cases of covid19 as a graph of number of confirmed,recovered and death patients.
Made it as a personal project to sharpen my skills in web Development.

# Tech Used

- React
- Redux
- Heroku for deployment

The main work of this website is to work with Api's, collect and transform data and render it to the desktop.

# What for you?

- As a react beginner you can clone this repo and use it to understand the the work flow of react-redux, how they work together and also understand how to use API's.
- Also I have used Apex chart library for the chart, so you can get to know how to have a chart in your website
- There's no backend!! It's just a game of API
- Exlopre the code, modify it, get inspired by it, or even make changes to this code.:)
